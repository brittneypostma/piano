          and dislike men who are so beguiled and demoralized by the
          charms of pleasure of the moment, so blinded by desire, that
          they cannot foresee the pain and trouble that are bound to ensue;
          and equal blame belongs to those who fail in their duty through
          weakness of will, which is the same as saying through shrinking
          rom toil and pain. These cases are perfectly simple and easy to
          distinguish. In a free hour, when our power of choice is
          untrammelled and when nothing prevents our being able to do what
          we like best, every pleasure is to be welcomed and every pain avoided.
          But in certain circumstances and owing to the claims of duty or the
          obligations of business it will frequently occur that pleasures have
          to be repudiated and annoyances accepted. The wise man therefore
          always holds in these matters to this principle of selection: he
          rejects pleasures to secure other greater pleasures, or else he
          endures pains to avoid worse pains."</p>
